    "3. <b>r^2  is (1 - SSres/SStot)</b>. we try to find a line to minimize the SSres. R^2 tells us how good is the line from the average line. R^2 has to be maximized i.e towards +1. R^2 can be -1. This can happen when your fitted line is way worse than the average line. It tells us how well our line is fitted to the data.\n",
    "4. Adjusted R^2: more variables in model, the R^2 method is not a good way to go. so here we get rid of the variables that don't have any effect on the model. say we add a new variable and say SSres decreases, R^2 will increase if other way the coeff of it becomes 0 as this new variable doesn't bring any decrease in SSres and thus R^2 will remain the same. So it will never decrease. if new variable has no effect on the model, then R^2 will be different but we won't know if it has any effect on the model actually. Adusted R^2 penalises us when we add the independent variable that don't help our model ie they don't minimize SSres. <b>Adj R^2 = 1- (1-R^2)(n-1)/(n-p-1)</b>\n",
